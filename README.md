- 👋 Hi, I’m @RockabellAllana
- 👀 I’m interested in learning computer languages and working my way into Software Engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and C++, but I intend to expand into C# soon :) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to meet professionals who have advice for gaining traction in this field
You'll see most of my profile is pet projects and ideas, I am still learning how to get the most out of GitHub
If you have any advice for projects I could try to bolster my education and make a bigger impact don't hesitate!
